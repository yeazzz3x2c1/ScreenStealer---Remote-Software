First of all... students asked me to name the project "ScreenStealler," but the project isn't really a "stealer" that steals screenshots from others; it works like "TeamViewer": you enter others' ID to control their computer.

Just to clarify, in case anyone misunderstands and thinks the project is a hacking tool :p

(And I have found out that "Stealler" is not a correct word; I'll fix that in the whole project in the future.)
